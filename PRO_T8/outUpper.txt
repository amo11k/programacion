NOTHING COMPARES, NO WORRIES OR CARES
REGRETS AND MISTAKES, THEY'RE MEMORIES MADE
WHO WOULD HAVE KNOWN HOW BITTERSWEET THIS WOULD TASTE?

NEVER MIND, I'LL FIND SOMEONE LIKE YOU
I WISH NOTHING BUT THE BEST FOR YOU
DON'T FORGET ME, I BEG, I REMEMBER YOU SAID
SOMETIMES IT LASTS IN LOVE, BUT SOMETIMES IT HURTS INSTEAD
